# Knight's Tour Problem

The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess problem where a knight is placed on an empty chessboard and must move according to the rules of chess such that it visits each square exactly once.

## Existing Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In the context of the Knight's Tour problem, DFS is implemented with backtracking to find a valid sequence of moves for the knight.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices at the same depth level before moving on to the next level. In the context of the Knight's Tour problem, BFS is used to find the shortest sequence of moves for the knight to visit every square.

## ShadowWalker Algorithm

The ShadowWalker algorithm is an original algorithm designed to solve the Knight's Tour problem. It uses a combination of heuristics and backtracking to find a valid sequence of moves for the knight. The name "ShadowWalker" is meant to evoke a sense of stealth and agility, reflecting the knight's ability to move in unconventional ways across the chessboard.
